Web scraper structure:

1. Have a factory class which creates appropriate Scraper depending on website we want to scrape.
2. Since we will have lots of faulty urls, we will need custom filters to make out the non-sensical ones.
Will use similar factory pattern, but this time with Strategies (filters) which will be applied on url lists
